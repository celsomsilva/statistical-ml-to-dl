# ML Bridge: From Statistical Models to Deep Learning

> **Under Construction**: This repository is currently in development.  
> The code and notebooks will be released once the initial version is ready.  

---

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by my postgraduate studies at **USP**, where I achieved a final grade of **9.0** in the thesis and **10.0** in both final exams.  
The committee described the work as *“interesting and challenging”*, highlighting its originality and depth.  

Building on that foundation, this repository evolves the original ideas into a broader initiative:  
a **bridge** from traditional statistical machine learning to modern deep learning architectures.

## About

This project explores the transition from **classical statistical machine learning** to **modern deep learning architectures**.  
It is designed as a **bridge** between the two worlds — highlighting theory, experiments, and practical insights.  

The journey will cover:  
- Traditional statistical approaches  
- Their limitations and strengths  
- Step-by-step transformation 

---

## Goals

- Build a conceptual and practical *bridge* from statistics to deep learning  
- Compare models using rigorous evaluation metrics  
- Provide clean, reproducible code and notebooks  
- Deliver insights valuable to both researchers and practitioners
